# Google Homepage
## Description
This project is to create a clone of the Google homepage. The goal of this project is to apply the HTML and CSS skills learned in the Foundations track of The Odin Project open source curriculum.
## Self-Reflection
The hardest part of the project was setting the elements around the input field. The header and footer were straightforward, as there are good tutorials on the web to figure these out. Looking back, maybe I should have used flex for the header and footer. I also think I was not strategic with my use of containers. My styling is not very organized as well.

I understand the flow better now. Set your HTML structure first. Then, for styling, work in a "depth-first" manner. Style the smaller elements instead of styling the bigger elements first. It makes setting the items a lot easier when organizing items within containers, like the header and footer
